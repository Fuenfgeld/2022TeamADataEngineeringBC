# PySpark Branch
This Branch is used to experiment with PySpark and evaluate whether it is opportune to replace PETL with it for the ETL tutorial this group is creating. The `iris.json` data used in the notebook can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/iris-dataset-json-version). `The iris2.json`
dataset is simply given as the last row of `iris.json` formatted as `[last line]`.
