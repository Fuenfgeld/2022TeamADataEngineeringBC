# PySpark Branch
This Branch is used to experiment with PySpark and evaluate whether it is opportune to replace PETL with it for the ETL tutorial this group is creating. The `iris.json` data used in the notebook can be found on [GitHub](!wget -cq https://github.com/domoritz/maps/blob/master/data/iris.json). `The iris2.json`
dataset is simply given as the last row of `iris.json` formatted as `[last line]`.
