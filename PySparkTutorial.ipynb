        "### 0.1 What is Data Engineering ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Data engineering is the practice of designing and building systems for collecting, storing, and analyzing data at scale. Data engineers work in a variety of settings to build systems that collect, manage, and convert raw data into usable information for data scientists and business analysts to interpret. Their ultimate goal is to make data accessible so that organizations can use it to evaluate and optimize their performance. This last sentence also sums up the difference between a data engineer and a data analyst, whereas the former manages the data resources the later exploits them to gain valuable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 0.2 What is ETL ?\n",
        "\n",
        "According to IBM ETL, which stands for extract, transform and load, is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store. It is closely linked with the concept of a *Data Warehouse* that describes central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Extraction\n",
        "During data extraction, raw data is copied or exported from source locations from a variety of data sources, which can be structured or unstructured such as SQL databases, json files or even web pages.\n",
        "#### Transformation\n",
        "The collected raw data then undergoes data processing. Here, the data is transformed and consolidated for its intended analytical use case. Steps taken during transformation are de-duplicating values, performing calculations, translations, or summarizations based on the raw data and changing the shape of the data via joining and grouping operation in order to match the schema of the target data warehouse. The environment in which the transformation step is performed is also called *staging area*.\n",
        "#### Loading\n",
        "In this last step, the transformed data is moved from the staging area into a target data warehouse. Typically, this involves an initial loading of all data, followed by periodic loading of incremental data changes \n",
        "\n",
        "### 0.3 What is Spark ?\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the official website\n",
        "\n",
        ">*Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.*\n",
        "\n",
        "Now what does that mean ? You can think of Spark as a programming library that allows you to outsource your data engineering workflow to a set of servers (cluster) which enables you to parallelize operations, enabling faster execution and the ability to work with amounts of data that couldn't be handled on a single computer (Big Data). \n",
        "\n",
        "Hence what Spark does is managing the interaction between your local  node (computer) and each node (server) of the cluster. Since Spark was originally written in Scala there is no direct way to access its functionality in Python. This is where *PySpark* comes into play. You can think of PySpark as a Python-based wrapper on top of the Scala API. There are also similar wrappers for *R* and other programming languages, this is why the official website describes Spark as a *multi-language engine*. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### SparkSQL\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the *Resilient Distributed Dataset* (RDD) is the  fundamental data structure on which all higher-level data structures are constructed in Spark, this tutorial is going to focus on the *DataFrame* from the SparkSQL model which deals with structured data such as .json and .csv files. \n",
        "\n",
        "The DataFrame has two big advantages over the RDD. First it has  significant performance benefits over RDDs due to a powerful optimization engine and secondly important data science module such as *spark.streaming* an *spark.ml* work with DataFrames instead of RDDs.\n",
        " \n",
        "## 0.4. Conclusion.\n",
        "You learned what data engineering is,how an ETL workflow is structured and what role Spark plays in such a  contex. Now let's get started with coding stuff. \n",
        "\n",
        "The next three lines of code will make Pyspark and all the relevant data you need to finish this tutorial available in your Colab notebook.\n"

        "The core object of pyspark.sql is the *DataFrame* which stores the information obtained from external sources (.json, .csv files etc.) or created by the user within Python. To the humans eye the DataFrame behaves like a table, computationally however it is a more complex structure due to the distributed nature of spark objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we load in our first dataset in such a DataFrame we should talk about so called *schemas*. When reading in structured data from an external source it is often know to the user how the data is structured, for instance what the names and data types of the columns are. In contrast to the user however Spark doesn't have any idea about what the types and columns are going to look like.\n",
